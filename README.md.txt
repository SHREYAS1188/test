Install The Package

pip install myvectors

having installed math python library makes the things smoother 

Package Functionalities

As said above this package mainly deals with basic vector functions

## the vector is represented by LIST[data structure] here 
## ex: if v(2,3,4) is a vector at (2,3,4) then it should be written as v1=[2,3,4] where v1 is a list 

1. Magnitude of a vector : A=[2,3,4]

from myvector import mag
mag(A)
